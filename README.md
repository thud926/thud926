# About me

At the moment, I'm relatively new to coding.  I've had several attempts at learning in-depth, and this time I need to stick with it until I'm job-ready.
My goal is to transition from industrial maintenance and turnaround work to developer/programmer.

-  Iâ€™m currently learning ... HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, and React.
-  I'm re-learning the "Big 3" front-end languages and Bootstrap, the back-end material is new to me.
-  I plan to dig into Python and other languages in the very near future.
-  I'm still not "guru-level" with Linux, but I have previously managed to use a dual-boot install for a few years without botching it too badly.

-  Virtualbox has been quite a handy tool in learning my way around different flavors of Linux and other operating systems.

-  I hope to take things a step further by learning Docker.

-  I'll be updating parts of this repo and others as I learn.
